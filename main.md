## Jingyi(Kylie) He | 何靖怡
Hi there, my name is Jingyi(Kylie) He and I'm a final year undergraduate student from <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>. I'm majoring in <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-major-statistics-and-computer-science"> Statistics and Computer Science</a>. I'm an NLP enthusiast, with an ultimate goal of understanding how humans acquire a language and build an artificial intelligence that can reason like humans. During the last summer in my undergraduate, I conducted a research project under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/">Jackie Cheung</a> on pretrained word embeddings.
