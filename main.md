I am a first year M.Sc. computer science student at <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a> working with Professor [Yang Xu](www.cs.toronto.edu/~yangxu/index.html) in the [Computational Linguistics Group](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/index.html). My research interest lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Cognitive Science and Machine Learning.

In particular, my current research involves building computational models that: 1) support learning and using natural language in human-like ways; and 2) help us understand the underlying cognitive mechanisms of human's linguistic capabilities, such as lexical innovation. I believe that this line of cross-disciplinary research has the potential to advance both cognitive science and machine learning.

Before coming to Toronto, I spent three years as an undergraduate at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca), Montreal, where I worked with [Prof. Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/index.html), [Prof. Timothy O'Donnell](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~timothy.odonnell/), and [Prof. Thomas Shultz](https://www.tomshultz.net) on both NLP and cognitive science research projects.
